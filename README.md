    Code refactor of Chart and its subclasses, where initially everything, including function and UI, were within one big class. It has since moved, so that UI is on ChartDisplay and its subclasses, while functional is under Chart and its subclasses.

    Code refactor of feature 5, transformation. Originally, all of the transformation related functions were inside DataTable. However, seeing as how it was getting more and more complex, I had the idea of creating a new class to contain all of the functions.
    Later, some of this will also be refactored into two different sources, one for functionality and another for UI.

## Notes:
- Our commits were approximately four times the amount of what it should have because two of our members accidentally had the wrong commit email,
so during fixing it, all of those members' commit were replicated by the new email that is linked to the account instead.
- We didn't use any pull request since we were always working together, so all of us worked on the master branch instead. We have confirmed this with Prof. Kenneth and he told us that it is fine since he saw us working together several times, and to tell the TAs that according to him it is alright.
