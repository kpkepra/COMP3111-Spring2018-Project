**Question: Attribute visibility**

**Tags:** `act1` `uml`

For the COMP3111 Project activity 1(UML diagram), do we have to show the visibility for each attributes (i.e. +, #, - next to the attributes of classes)?

	Class attributes and operations should be included.
	Example in slide 15-16, UML Modeling 1 lecture

**Question: Assignment 1 submission detail**

**Tags:** `act1` `uml` `use-case`

Does it mean that UML class diagram(and use-case) for each member has to be different or all the members are expected to submit the same work?

	The UML class/use-case diagram can be the same, or can be different.
	It won't count as plagiarism as the diagrams are agreed by the whole team.
	In any case, assignment 1 is an individual assessment.
