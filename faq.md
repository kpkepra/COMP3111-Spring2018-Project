**Question: What things and How to submit Activity 1/2?**

*Tags: act1, act2*

The submission details and deadlines can be found in Canvas. In short:

**Question: Any format for meeting minutes and Gantt chart?**

*Tags: act1, minutes, Gantt chart*

> **Meeting minutes:** Any suitable format. In particular, you should list out the agenda and the discussion items.  
> **Gantt chart:** It is flexible to use any tool (e.g. Excel, other online tools, ...) to draw a Gantt chart, which is just a variation of bar chart. Suggestion: x-axis (date), y-axis (tasks/sub-tasks), bars with 3 different colors representing 3 different team members 

**Question: About Animated Chart.**

Should we use one of the two decided charts and make it into an animation? Or should we put animated chart as a separate generalization for a chart class?

*Tags: act2, feature 6*

> There is no restriction. Teams can decide to implement multiple separated chart classes, or a generalized chart class with multiple subclasses, or an animate method in a chart. 

**Question: About Data Filtering and Transformation** 

Do we only need to implement 2 out of the given 4 algorithms?

**Question: Attribute visibility**

*Tags: act1, uml*

For the COMP3111 Project activity 1(UML diagram), do we have to show the visibility for each attributes (i.e. +, #, - next to the attributes of classes)?

> Class attributes and operations should be included. Example in slide 15-16, UML Modeling 1 lecture

**Question: Assignment 1 submission detail**

*Tags: act1, uml, use-case*

Does it mean that UML class diagram(and use-case) for each member has to be different or all the members are expected to submit the same work?

> The UML class/use-case diagram can be the same, or can be different. It won't count as plagiarism as the diagrams are agreed by the whole team. In any case, assignment 1 is an individual assessment.
